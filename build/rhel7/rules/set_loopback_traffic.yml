rationale: "Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is \ntypically\
    \ critical to operation of the system. The loopback interface \nis the only place\
    \ that loopback network traffic should be seen, all \nother interfaces should\
    \ ignore traffic on this network as an\nanti-spoofing measure."
